## Modifying a file:
Files are structured in Classic Markdown format. You can edit them directly on GitHub by clicking the pencil icon in the top right corner of the file. Have a look at the [GitHub Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) or [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/) for more information on how to format your text.

### Small edits
Click the small icon in the top right corner of the file. You can also use the [GitHub web editor](https://github.dev/) to edit files directly in the browser. This is a great option for small edits or quick fixes.

### Large edits
Either clone the repository to your local machine and `pip install -r requirements.txt` followed by a `mkdocs serve`. Alternatively, [codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) for a quick setup and preview the changes with `mkdocs serve`.
