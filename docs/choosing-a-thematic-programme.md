# Thematic programmes

An overview can be seen here: [KU Leuven biomedical sciences thematic programmes](https://gbiomed.kuleuven.be/english/phd/thematic-programmes)

From our own experiences, public health is a good thematic programme but has strict requirements in order to graduate. Most of us are in [Immunology and Microbiology](https://gbiomed.kuleuven.be/english/phd/PhD_Researchers/thematic_programmes/immunology_microbiology.html).
