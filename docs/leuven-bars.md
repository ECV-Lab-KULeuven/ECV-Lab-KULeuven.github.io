# Our recommended bars

I've heard the breakout room on the 10th floor at the rega are very good.

Some bars that people in the lab are fond of:
-   [Malz](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9fJxF2T5ZEFBVTpy7)
-   [Metafoor](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ySan7TcTM72eVGXQ6) (really, only one is fond of this but she drags everyone here).
-   [Giraf](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pMujoQdiuQQYFBA17) (famous in our lab for shots with bugs in it!)
