# Moving to Leuven: A Starter Guide

Welcome to Leuven! This guide provides essential information to help you settle in quickly and comfortably as you join our lab.

## Introduction to Leuven

Leuven is a charming university city located in the Flemish region of Belgium. Home to KU Leuven, one of Europe's oldest and most prestigious universities, the city offers a perfect blend of historic architecture, vibrant student life, and modern research facilities.

Keep in mind that Leuven is compact. With a bike (which you can obtain through KU Leuven), you can reach most places within 15 minutes. Many locations are within walking distance, except for some areas like Rega campus.

## Transportation

Cycling is the most popular way to get around Leuven. KU Leuven offers bicycle rental services through [KU Leuven Bike](https://admin.kuleuven.be/td/intranet/en/mobility/2WD/2wd). The city is very bike-friendly with dedicated cycling paths.
