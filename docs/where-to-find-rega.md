- Take the train to Leuven station (not to be confused with Louvain-La- Neuve!).
- Upon arrival at Leuven station, exit the train station and head right to find the bus station (the red-brick building). From there, go to Platform 2 to catch a bus to Gasthuisberg.

### By bus from leuven railway station:

- Campus Gasthuisberg is easily accessible by bus. Several bus lines (40, 41, 42, 43,…) depart from Platform 2 approximately every 10-15 minutes, heading to Leuven Gasthuisberg Kliniek. These buses stop at the main entrance of the university’s hospital.Check the general electronic time table that is available at the bus station or the link below for more details.
- Bus 43 (film: Haasrode Brabanthal - Leuven Gasthuisberg Campus) stops right in front of building Onderwijs en Navorsing 2 (ON2) (stop Gasthuisberg Campus - this is the final stop). This stop is close to the Rega Institute.  Walk uphill, pass the Rode Kruis building, and you will find the Rega Institute (a grey building with stairs in front) on your right.

You can access the parking under the Rega Institute and park your bike in the designated area. To enter the building, leave the parking via the entrance gate, go left and enter the building via the main entrance.

## On Foot 🚶:
### From the hospital entrance to the Rega Institute
- From the main entrance of the hospital, visitors follow a route like a metro plan. The color principle, which partly determines UZ Leuven’s identity, will remain the basis. Via street, gate and level, if necessary followed by a letter, they will reach the correct destination.
- Follow the “Blauwe Straat (BL)” to “Gate 8”.
- At Gate 8, look for the arrow mentioning “Rega Institute”. Follow the arrow to reach the institute’s front desk via the stairs outside (see map below)
- Alternatively, you can hop off at bus stop “Lemmens Instituut”, walk uphill, pass the Rode Kruis building, and you will find the Rega Institute (a grey building with stairs in front) on your right (approximately 10 minutes walking)
